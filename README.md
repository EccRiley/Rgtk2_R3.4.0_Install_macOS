# Rgtk2_R3.4.0_Install_macOS

Trying to find a solution to installing the _`Rgtk2`_ package (`v2.20.33`) in _`R`_ (`v3.4.0`) on _`macOS Sierra`_ (`v10.12.5`), and hoping a repository documenting the process will be useful for others with similar issues now or in the future.

-----

I have experienced several post-update/install roadblocks with _`macOS`_ (`v10.12.5`) with the _`R`_ (`v3.4.0` "`You Stupid Darkness`" [BTW: couldn't have said it better myself]; 2017-04-21) and _`RStudio`_ (`v1.0.143`; preview [2017-04-13] & non-preview [2017-04-19]) releases that (appear to) boil down to the _`RGtk2`_ (`v2.20.33`) package. I have scoured the interwebs for potential solutions & for fellow sufferers of the same issue(s) on these versions of _`R/RStudio/RGtk2`_ and  have only run into more roadblocks in doing so. Thus, I'm starting this repo as a place to (1) Crowdsource a solution outside of _Stackoverflow_ and (2) Document the solution-finding quest in terms of what works for my system & setup(s), what doesn't, and whatever information I can get about what doesn't work, so that, hopefully, others can benefit from comparing the various solutions I try.
